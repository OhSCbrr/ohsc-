> The PC version is recommended over the mobile version, but it requires your PC to have Bluetooth.

> For the best experience, it's recommended to use a Bluetooth dongle instead of your PC's built-in Bluetooth or the Lovense dongle, as those tend to have a shorter range or may cause lag.

2. Click on your Account in the top-right corner under Menu.

3. A unique API Key will be displayedâ€”copy this key securely, as it is required for authentication.

### Important Notes

- Never share your API Key with others, as it grants access to your PiShock device.

- If you suspect your API Key has been compromised, regenerate a new key immediately.

- Ensure your PiShock devices are connected and powered ON.

  - You can verify this by going to the PiShock website and testing them with the TEST button.
